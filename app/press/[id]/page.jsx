**SAN FRANCISCO, CA - March 20, 2024** - PROMPTOMY, the leading marketplace for AI prompts and prompt engineering tools, today announced it has raised $50 million in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, and OpenAI Startup Fund. The funding will accelerate product development, expand the team, and fuel global adoption of AI prompt engineering best practices.

## Democratizing AI Through Better Prompts

Founded in 2023 by former OpenAI researcher Sarah Chen and ex-Meta Principal Engineer Marcus Rodriguez, PROMPTOMY has quickly become the go-to platform for discovering, creating, and optimizing AI prompts. The platform serves over 100,000 active users, from individual creators to Fortune 500 companies, who have collectively generated over 1 million prompts and earned more than $5 million through the marketplace.

"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how humans interact with AI systems," said Sarah Chen, CEO and Co-Founder of PROMPTOMY. "Prompt engineering is becoming as essential as coding was in the early days of software development. Our mission is to make this critical skill accessible to everyone, not just AI researchers."

## Addressing the Prompt Engineering Skills Gap

As AI adoption accelerates across industries, organizations are struggling with a critical skills gap in prompt engineering. Recent studies show that 78% of companies using AI tools report that their employees lack the expertise to create effective prompts, leading to suboptimal AI performance and missed productivity gains.

PROMPTOMY addresses this challenge through three core offerings:

- **Marketplace**: A curated collection of high-quality prompts across categories including business, creative writing, coding, marketing, and education
- **Generator**: AI-powered tools that help users create, test, and optimize prompts with real-time feedback
- **Education**: Comprehensive learning resources, tutorials, and certification programs for prompt engineering

## Rapid Growth and Market Validation

The company has experienced explosive growth since launch:
- 100,000+ active users across 25+ countries
- 1M+ prompts created on the platform
- $5M+ in creator earnings distributed
- 500% month-over-month growth in enterprise adoption
- Partnerships with leading universities including Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon

"PROMPTOMY is building the infrastructure layer for the AI economy," said Marc Andreessen, Co-Founder of Andreessen Horowitz. "Just as GitHub became essential for software development, PROMPTOMY is becoming essential for AI development. The team's deep technical expertise and vision for democratizing AI make them uniquely positioned to capture this massive opportunity."

## Enterprise Adoption Accelerating

Major enterprises are increasingly turning to PROMPTOMY to standardize their AI workflows and train their workforce in prompt engineering best practices. Recent enterprise customers include:

- **Global consulting firm**: Reduced AI project delivery time by 60% using PROMPTOMY's enterprise prompt library
- **Fortune 500 retailer**: Improved customer service AI accuracy by 40% through optimized prompts
- **Leading media company**: Accelerated content creation workflows by 3x using PROMPTOMY's creative writing prompts

"The ROI we've seen from PROMPTOMY is unprecedented," said Jennifer Walsh, Chief Innovation Officer at a Fortune 500 financial services company. "Our teams went from struggling with inconsistent AI outputs to confidently deploying AI solutions across multiple business units. PROMPTOMY didn't just give us better prompts – it gave us a competitive advantage."

## Investment in AI Safety and Research

A significant portion of the Series A funding will be dedicated to AI safety research and developing tools to prevent prompt injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. PROMPTOMY is establishing an AI Safety Lab led by Dr. Emily Watson, former research scientist at DeepMind.

"As AI becomes more powerful and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety and reliability of AI interactions becomes critical," said Dr. Watson. "We're committed to building the most secure and trustworthy prompt engineering platform in the industry."

## Future Roadmap

The funding will support several key initiatives:

- **Global Expansion**: Localization for international markets and support for non-English prompts
- **Advanced AI Integration**: Integration with next-generation AI models and multimodal capabilities
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced analytics, team collaboration tools, and enterprise security features
- **Educational Programs**: Expansion of certification programs and partnerships with educational institutions
- **Research & Development**: Continued investment in prompt optimization algorithms and AI safety research

## About PROMPTOMY
